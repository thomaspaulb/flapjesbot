# nairobi-traffic-telegram-bot
Telegram Bot for splitting bills

Before installation I had to do:

    sudo pip install --upgrade urllib3
    sudo pip install urllib3[secure]

To remove some warnings.
And then:

    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

Now [Talk to Botfather to create a bot and receive a token](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather)

Now copy `config-template.py` to `config.py` and insert the token as `API_KEY` there.
